# VPS scripts

## Overview

This should provide a set of simple shell scripts which may help setting your
Debian Squeeze VPS (with tools for benchmarking).

## Quick usage

1. Download: wget -q https://github.com/downloads/TigersWay/VPS/vps-0.5.tar.gz --no-check-certificate -O - | tar xz
2. Run: bash vps.sh

You will then find 3 main options:

* minimal (Light Debian server + SSH)
* basics (hostname, timezone, APT sources)
* lowendbox (LEA style: syslogd, xinetd, dropbear)

and a set of different commands:

* dotdeb
* apache
* nginx
* mysql
* phpfpm
* lamp ((Apache + MySQL(MyISAM) + PHP5-FPM)
* lemp (nginx + MySQL(MyISAM) + PHP5-FPM)
* domain <[subdomain.]domain.tld>
* polipo (Light-weight SOCKS & HTTP proxy)
* tinyproxy (DEPRECATED Light-weight HTTP/HTTPS proxy)
* pptp (Tunneling)

As a developer, I personally first run
`bash vps.sh basics lowendbox` which gives me a light (~ 5M) box, then
`bash vps.sh dotdeb apache nginx mysql phpfmp domain dev.example.com` and I am then able to switch apache and nginx anytime with
`bash vps.sh nginx` or
`bash vps.sh apache`.
